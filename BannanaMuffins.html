        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 tablespoons of unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/3 cup sweetner (sugar, honey, maple syrup, etc)</li>
            <li>1 cup mashed ripe bannana, approximately 3 medium bannanas</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cup flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a muffin tin with cooking spray or line with paper liners.</li>
            <li>Place the butter in a large bowl and melt in the microwave. Add the honey or maple syrup, mashed banana, milk and vanilla to the bowl. Whisk to combine. Whisk in the eggs. Sprinkle the cinnamon, baking soda and salt over the wet ingredients. Whisk until well combined. Add the flour to the bowl and stir with a large spoon or spatula until barely combined. Be careful to not over-mix.</li>
            <li>Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin tin, filling each cup about 2/3 full. I like to use a large scoop.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15-17 minutes until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean. (Mini muffins will take about 10-12 minutes to bake.)</li>
            <li>Let muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes and then remove to a wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
